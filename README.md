# Assignment explained
For this assignment, as we understand it, we need to make a app where the user can log in, add pokémon to their collection and view their collection.
We chose to only display 20 pokémon, for simplicity and performence.

# How to use
- You start in the login page, you have no access to the other pages without logging in. Type in your name and press the go button.
- You are now in the catalogue page, here is a collection of pokémon, click on the catch button next to a pokémon to catch it. When a pokémon is collected a catched symbol will replace the catch button.
- Click the trainer button in the top right of the screen to go to the trainer page.
- You are now in the trainer page, here you will see which pokémon you have collected. Next to every pokémon is a release button, this will remove the pokémon from the collection and makes it catchable again in the catalogue page.
- Click on the cymbol and name of the app in the top left of the screen to return to the catalogue page.
- Click on the log out button next to the trainer button in the top right of the page to log out and return to the log in page.
